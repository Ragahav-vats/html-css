	    	<p>Pandas are black and white bears that live in the bamboo forests of central China. 
	    	They are known for their distinctive coloration and their love of bamboo.
	    	 Pandas are classified as omnivores, but their diet primarily consists of bamboo, 
	    	which they consume in large quantities throughout the day.</p>
